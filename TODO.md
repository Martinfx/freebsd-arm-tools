TODO
====
* <del>Should be able to read help message without being root</del>
* <del>Should not have to wait for source update before preflight check</del>
* <del>Add notification after source update (once it has been moved after the pre-flight)</del>
* User should confirm checkout of source in case there has been an error in directory setup.
* Add switch for compression of image at end.
* Add swap.
* Add fstab line for swap, if opted for.
* Add interactive flow.
* Probably don't need notifications for both World Build Complete and ALL Build Complete - they are only 4 seconds apart.
