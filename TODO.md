TODO
====
* Add switch for compression of image at end.
* Allow user to edit portsnap.conf
* Add interactive flow.
* Look up svn revision before pre-flight so it doesnt have to be set twice.
* Add sanity checks:
** Check sizes, e.g. Can't add ports to a 1 GB image with a 512MB swap, and the like.
** No point in updating svn if no build and vice versa.
